      <description>The effect of relatedness on group and community structure in Tanganyikan cichlids Sorry, your browser doesn&#39;t support HTML5 video.  Individual fish were motion-tracked for 10 minutes with each colour and box representing the movement profile of one animal  For my Master’s thesis I investigated how the genetic relatedness of individuals influences group interactions and community structure in a social cichlid species. I looked at group living and nest building behaviours in Neolamprologus multifasciatus, the smallest cichlid species in the world, and endemic to Lake Tanganyika in Zambia.</description>

      <description>I am a biologist with a background in immunology, molecular toxicology and behaviour. Originally from the Black Forest region of Southwestern Germany, I began my studies at the University of Freiburg under Prof. Dr. Klaus Warnatz at the Centrum für Chronische Immundefizienz (CCI), conducted my Erasmus at the University of Uppsala, and recently completed my Masters of Biological Sciences at the University of Konstanz, in the Department of Collective Behaviour at the Max-Planck-Institute for Animal Behaviour under Prof.</description>

      <description>My first experience in research, working in a molecular immunology lab isolating B cells and evaluating their cytokine expression, fostered in me a deep interest in molecular biology. During my Erasmus I became interested in the ecological aspect of biology and took courses in limnology and marine biology. Not neglecting the molecular opportunities there, I also attended courses in human physiology and evolutionary genetics.
During my Master’s studies, I became interested in linking the broader ecological and behavioural impacts to underlying molecular mechanisms.</description>

      <description>Cytokine production of B cells in patients with variable immune deficiency  B cell subpopulations of a healthy donor (left) and a CVID patient showing CD21low B cells (right)
  For my Bachelor’s project, I investigated the Cytokine production of B cells, especially of CD21low B cells, in a subgroup of patients with common variable immune deficiency (CVID). CVID is the most common primary immune deficiency in adults, and is characterised by recurrent infections, low antibody levels in at least two immunoglobulin types, and immune dysregulation.</description>
