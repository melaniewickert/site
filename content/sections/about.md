I am a biologist with a background in immunology, molecular toxicology and behaviour. Originally from the Black Forest region of Southwestern Germany, I began my studies at the University of Freiburg under Prof. Dr. Klaus Warnatz at the Centrum f√ºr Chronische Immundefizienz (CCI), conducted my Erasmus at the University of Uppsala, and recently completed my Masters of Biological Sciences at the University of Konstanz in the summer of 2018, under Prof. Dr. Iain Couzin in the Department of Collective Behaviour at the Max-Planck-Institute for Animal Behaviour.
