My first actual experience in research, working in a molecular immunology lab isolating b cells and evaluating their cytokine expression, fostered a deep interest in molecular biology. Throughout my Erasmus I started to become interested in the ecological aspect of biology and therefore took courses in limnology and marine biology, not neglecting the molecular opportunities there I also attended courses in human physiology and evolutionary genetics.

During my Masterâ€™s studies, I became interested in the broader, ecological, behavioural, and ultimately evolutionary context which gave rise to them. Leading me to study molecular toxicology, more specifically the reaction of kidney cells to drug compounds, marine bio toxins and, also driven by my love of diving, to perform field work investigating the underlying mechanisms governing behavioural interactions within communities of African cichlids. These experiences have fostered a great appreciation for the many scale of biological relevance and how our understanding of a system is governed by the scale at which we investigate it.

In additional to being able to bring my own unique perspective, and awareness of ecological, behavioural and evolutionary relevance to any project. Be it as part of a team of researchers in a large company or in a start up where one must wear many hats, in the future I hope to further develop the skills necessary for more applied areas of research, in particular in the realm of research organisation and team management.
