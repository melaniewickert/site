My first actual experience in research, working in a molecular immunology lab isolating b cells and evaluating their cytokine expression, fostered in me a deep interest in molecular biology. During my Erasmus I expanded my interest into the ecological aspect of biology and took courses in limnology and marine biology. Not neglecting the molecular opportunities there, I also attended courses in human physiology and evolutionary genetics.

During my Master’s studies, I became interested in the broader, ecological, behavioural, and ultimately evolutionary context which gave rise to them. This led me to study molecular toxicology, more specifically the reaction of kidney cells to drug compounds, marine biotoxins and—-driven by my love of diving—-to perform field work investigating the underlying mechanisms governing behavioural interactions within communities of African cichlids. These experiences have fostered a great appreciation for biological relevance and how our understanding of a system is governed by the scale at which we investigate it.

In additional to being able to bring my own unique perspective, and awareness of ecological, behavioural and evolutionary relevance to any project. Be it as part of a team of researchers in a large company or in a startup where one must wear many hats, in the future I hope to further develop the skills necessary for more applied areas of research, in particular in the realm of research organisation and team management.
